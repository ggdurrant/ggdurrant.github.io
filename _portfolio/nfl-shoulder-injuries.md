National Football League (NFL) Injured Reserve (IR) lists for the years 1980 to 2019 were pulled from Pro Sports Transactions and entries were queried to find quarterbacks who were placed on the IR with a shoulder injury. 

50 quarterbacks were found to have long-term shoulder injuries, and a subset of these were selected who had first-time shoulder surgery on their dominant, throwing arm. Manual searches were performed to verify the nature of the injury and determine dates of surgery. Age-matched controls were selected with the following criteria:
 - same years of experience 
 - same number of career seasons +/- 5
 - same year of NFL play +/- 10
