About Me
======

I am a recent graduate who is eager to apply novel bioengineering and computational techniques to help innovate for the medical field. I come from a family of healthcare workers and was an EMT, so I love contributing to ideas that could improve medical devices on the frontlines of healthcare. My research interests also include bioinformatics, biomechanics and human locomotion, and imaging techniques. 

I was born in the UK and moved to the US as a child, where I am now a dual citizen. I grew up all over but spent most of my time on a farm where I cared for animals from chickens, cows, goats, and pigs. I even started an egg delivery business with my brother which lasted 6 years, won a local small business award, and gave 25% of the profits to Heifer International, a charity I'm very fond of which provides livestock and support for small farmers in developing countries - you can check them out here: [Heifer International](http://heifer.org).

Outside of work I love soccer, rugby, sailing, travel, live music, and running. 


Travel
-------

I have lived in several places, with my family or for work, school, or internships. Moving around a lot as a kid helped develop my love to travel, whcih I satisfy with everything rom road trips to hiking to backpacking. I haven't been to nearly enough national parks, hostels, or continents, but I've made a start and will try to whittle down the list every chance I can. Here you can see a mainly complete list of all the places I have lived for at least a few months, places I have visited more than just passing through, and my dream trips on the list:
